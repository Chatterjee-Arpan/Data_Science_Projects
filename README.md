* The `Sales Analysis` project analyzes Rossmann store sales by loading and merging daily transaction records with store metadata, performing exploratory data analysis (including missing-data heatmaps, distribution plots, correlation matrices, and outlier checks), enriching the dataset with holiday and promotion information, and finally using **Facebook Prophet** to build and visualize time-series forecasts of future sales at the individual store level.

* The `Sentiment Analysis` project performs sentiment analysis on Amazon Alexa customer reviews by loading a TSV dataset, inspecting and engineering basic features (e.g. review length), conducting exploratory data analysis (including distributions of ratings and sentiment, and word clouds of overall and negative reviews), building a textâ€‘cleaning pipeline (to remove punctuation and stopwords), vectorizing the cleaned text with `CountVectorizer`, and training and evaluating two classifiers: **Multinomial Naive Bayes** and **Logistic Regression**, to predict whether a review is positive or negative.
